Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. In the game, players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and their placement. A single puzzle is released daily, with all players attempting to solve the same word. It was inspired by word games like Jotto and the game show Lingo.

Originally developed as a personal project for Wardle and his partner, Wordle was publicly released in October 2021. It gained widespread popularity in late 2021 after the introduction of a shareable emoji-based results format, which led to viral discussion on social media. The game's success spurred the creation of numerous clones, adaptations in other languages, and variations with unique twists, such as Quordle and Heardle. Wordle was played 4.8 billion times during 2023.

In January 2022, Wordle was acquired by The New York Times Company for a seven-figure sum and integrated into its games platform the following month. While the Times initially preserved the game's core mechanics, it later introduced minor modifications, including editorial oversight and word list adjustments. The acquisition also led to concerns about potential monetization, though the game remained free-to-play.
